# Employee Tracker


## About The Application

This application allows you to access your employee database! From there it allows you to navigate in multiple different ways such as;

* View all of the departments in the company

* View all the different roles inside the company

* View all employees currently employed with the company

* The ability to add a new department as well as add a new role

* The ability to add in a new employee to the database, as well as update an existing one!

It does this all from the convenience of node, utilizing inquirer!

## Issues

I ran into a few issues when building this, some were solved, some I used a workaround!

* One issue I had was solidifying the whole 'JOIN' mechanic used inside of mysql, in the end I figured it out.

* Another issue I had was trying to get the manager's name to appear when you select "View All Employees" it had me quite stumped, so instead I just added in the manager's ID

* A very minor issue was, I was having trouble just thinking up all the different details of this imaginary company, but I had fun with it and got the database seeded!

## Screenshots

Below I will include a video of the application working as well as some screenshots!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I enjoyed this project to the extent of learning mysql a bit more! I just have to solidify the workings of it a bit more (looking at you JOIN), other than that, it wasn't terribly difficult and well, I appreciated that part of it too!
